# rfid reader

main.cpp contains the finished untested program for an rfid reader. Based on [miguelbalboa](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)'s
library.

sketch.zip is an early phase of the program foundation, includes an relay, resistors and LED's. Developed with [wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), which is an program that simulate microcontrollers. Sadly there is no rfid scanners availible here. The simulation can be found [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/327557999092564564/)
